# Economic-Impact-on-Well-being-Data-Analysis-
In this project, we used Python with libraries like Pandas and NumPy to process and analyze the data, and visualized the results with Seaborn. By applying statistical and machine learning methods, we will  discover key links between financial stress and mental health.
